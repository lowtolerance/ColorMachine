I was inspired to create this after reading a comment on CSS-Tricks.com, where someone
made an observation that it would be cool to see a webpage that could analyze an image and 
change the background to best suit it. Well, that is what this attempts to do.

It uses the <canvas> element and the getImageData() function to analyze an image and return its average color, as well as its complimentary color.

The images included are not my own, nor is the jquery.color.js plugin(I am working on eliminating reliance on jQuery for this project). Also, ignore the half-assed layout. It is just a quick demonstration for testing purposes.

I am learning Javascript, but I am not an expert. I am very interested in using it to manipulate canvases, so any help/tips/optimizations would be very much appreciated.
